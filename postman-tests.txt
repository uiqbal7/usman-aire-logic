Postman Tests

I created a few API tests from what I could find and investigate on the game. Please import the collection and environment config. You can then use the postman runner to run the automated test.

Below is my approach along with what I found and saw from testing.

I decided to create a sanity folder where I could just do simple tests to get back a HTTP response. This is sometimes referred to as smoke tests. The idea behind this is so that you know the service is up and running

Sanity Test
 - createNewGame-200
 - createNewGame-400
 - getGameCreated-200
 - getGameCreated-not found (When running a GET for a game that never existed. I was expecting the API to return a response of not found. Instead, it creates a game.)


 Test Scenarios
 - [Test Case 1] - Add a single cookie
 - [Test Case 2] - SETUP - Sell a single cookie
 - [Test Case 2] - Sell a single cookie
 - [Test Case 3] - Sell more cookies than you have
 - [Test Case 4] - Buy a factory
 - [Test Case 5] Check overall status

 Comments
 - [Test Case 2] - Sell a single cookie] 
 	- When you sell a cookie the response returns "result: null". The result should show the remaining amount the player has, unless this is by design.

 - [Test Case 4] - Buy a factory
 	- When you purchase a factory, the response doesn't return a integer value for result rather than null. This should be changed to reflect like when adding a cookie.
